Provide two widgets, showing lists of the most and reast read posts.

== Description ==
"Most And Least Read Posts Widget" is a free plugin for Wordpress, developed by the Whiletrue.it staff to generate lists of the most and least read posts.

The following options are customizable:

* number of posts to show
* exclude posts whose title contains certain words
* show post hits after the title (style customizable via CSS class)
* exclude posts older than XX days

The plugin starts counting hits once activated, storing them in the "custom_total_hits" custom field without the need of external accounts.

The most popular web crawlers (e.g. Googlebot) are recognized and their hits discarded; also Admin hits are discarded.

Archived post hits are shown in a column inside the backend post list.

The plugin is compatible with multi-language WPML plugin, showing most/least read posts for current language.

Optionally, the number of hits can be shown inside the post content, with:

* a custom phrase, e.g. "This post has already been read XX times!"
* a custom position (above the post, below the post, both)
* a custom CSS style

If you want to show the post hits anywhere inside the template loop, you can the php function provided, e.g.: 
`<?php echo most_and_least_read_posts_get_hits(get_the_ID()); ?>`

== Installation ==
Best is to install directly from WordPress. If manual installation is required, please make sure to put all of the plugin files in a folder named `most_and_least_read_posts_widget` (not two nested folders) in the plugin directory, then activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get an error message that says "no results available" =
The plugin starts collecting hits once installed, so there are "no results available" for a short time, until the first data is stored. 
It's better to show the widget some hours (or days) after having installed it.

= The same post shows up multiple times =
This uncommon issue can be caused by duplicated custom fields in some posts. 
To solve it, inspect the post custom fields and delete unnecessary duplicates of the "custom_total_hits" field. 

= Can I customize the thumbs? =
Yes, you can do it editing the "mlrp_ul" class in your template style.css file.
E.g. 50x50 pixels images, floating on the right:
.mlrp_ul img { width: 50px; height: 50px; float: right; }
