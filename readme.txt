== Description ==
"Most And Least Read Posts Widget" is a free plugin for Wordpress, developed by the Whiletrue.it staff to generate lists of the most and least read posts.

The following options are customizable:
* number of posts to show
* exclude post whose title contains certain words

The plugin starts counting hits once activated, storing them in the "custom_total_hits" custom field without the need of external accounts.

The most popular web crawlers (e.g. Googlebot) are recognized and their hits discarded.
