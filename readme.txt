Provide two widgets, showing lists of the most and reast read posts.

== Description ==
"Most And Least Read Posts Widget" is a free plugin for Wordpress, developed by the Whiletrue.it staff to generate lists of the most and least read posts.

The following options are customizable:

* number of posts to show
* exclude post whose title contains certain words
* show post hits after the title (style customizable via CSS class)

The plugin starts counting hits once activated, storing them in the "custom_total_hits" custom field without the need of external accounts.

The most popular web crawlers (e.g. Googlebot) are recognized and their hits discarded.

Optionally, the number of hits can be shown inside the post content, with:

* a custom phrase, e.g. "This post has already been read XX times!"
* a custom position (above the post, below the post, both)
* a custom CSS style
